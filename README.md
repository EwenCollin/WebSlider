# WebSlider
Controlled web slides by phone. Can display any web page and control the page displayed from another device (a phone for example)

## How it works

### Basic setup

The presentation page, the one you want to show the slides on it is "main-slide.php", you have to call the page like so : "your.url/main-slide.php?p=\<your-presentation\>&s=\<your-slide\>"
  
  The control page, the page that control what is displayed on the first page is "slider-control.php", you have to call the page like so : "your.url/slider-control.php?p=\<your-presentation\>&s=\<your-slide\>"
